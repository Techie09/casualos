A Record is a named collection of publicly accessible permanent data. Records make it possible to store multiple distinct pieces of information in various forms and access them only when needed.

<GlossaryRef term="recordKey">Record keys</GlossaryRef> can be used to publish data to records, while any data that has been published to a record is publicly accessible.

There are currently two types of information that can be stored in records:

-   <GlossaryRef term='dataRecord'>Data</GlossaryRef>
-   <GlossaryRef term='fileRecord'>Files</GlossaryRef>
