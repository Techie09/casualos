## Data Actions

### `create(...mods)`


Creates a new bot or combination of bots with the given mods. Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> on all the created bots.
By default, bots are created with a unique <TagLink tag='id'/>, <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to the current `bot.id`, and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `shared`.
Bots must be created with at least one tag. If `create()` tries to make a bot with zero tags then an error will be thrown.

If <TagLink tag='creator'/> references a non-existent bot or a bot with a different <TagLink tag='space'/> than the created bot, then <TagLink tag='creator'/> will be set to `null`.

**Each parameter** is a mod that should be applied to the new bot(s).
If no parameters are specified, then the new bot will have its <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to `bot.id` and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `shared`.
If an array of mods is used for a parameter, then one bot will be created for _each unique combination of mods_.

#### Examples:

1. Create a red bot:
```typescript
let myRedBot = create({
    color: "red"
});
```

2. Create a parent and a child bot:
```typescript
let myParentBot = create({
    creator: null,
    label: "Parent"
});
let myChildBot = create({
    creator: getID(myParentBot),
    label: "Child"
});
```

3. Create a red bot in the `tempLocal` space:
```typescript
let myBot = create({ space: "tempLocal", color: "red" });
```

4. Create a bot from multiple mods:
```typescript
// myBot is placed in the "myDimension" dimension and is colored green
let myBot = create({ myDimension: true }, {
    color: "green"
});
```

5. Create a red bot and a blue bot:
```typescript
let [myRedBot, myBlueBot] = create({ creator: null}, [
    {
        "color": "red"
    },
    {
        "color": "blue"
    }
]);
```

### `destroy(bot)`


Removes the given bot, list of bots, or bot by <TagLink tag='id'/> and triggers <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/> for each of the destroyed bots.

Note that only destroyable bots will be destroyed.
Bots that have <TagLink tag='destroyable'/> set to `false` will not be destroyed.

Also note that all bots that have <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to the <TagLink tag='id'/> of a destroyed bot will also be destroyed (unless they are not destroyable).
This happens recursively until there are no more bots to destroy.

#### Examples:

1. Destroying a single bot:
```typescript
// Destroy a single bot that has #name set to "bob"
destroy(getBot("#name", "bob"));
```

2. Destroying a list of bots:
```typescript
// Destroy all the bots that have #color set to "red"
destroy(getBots("#color", "red"));
```

3. Destroying a bot by its id
```typescript
// Destroy the bot with the #id: "config"
destroy("config");
```

### `applyMod(bot, ...mods)`


Applies the given mods to the given bot.

The **first parameter** is the bot that the mods should be applied to.

The **other parameters** are the mods that should be applied to the bot. If two mods have the same tag, then the mod that is last in the list will win.

#### Examples

1. Set the "test" tag and "name" tag on a bot.
```typescript
applyMod(bot, {
    test: true,
    name: "bob"
});
```

### `subtractMods(bot, ...mods)`


Removes the tags contained in the given mod(s) from the given bot or mod.

The **first parameter** is the bot or mod that the tags should be removed from.

The **other parameters** are the bots or mods that contain the tags which should be removed from the original bot.

#### Examples:

1. Remove a mod from this bot.
```typescript
const mod = {
    color: 'red',
    name: 'bob'
};

subtractMods(this, mod);
```

2. Remove multiple mods from this bot.
```typescript
subtractMods(this, {
    color: 'red'

The **second parameter** is a string or regex that specifies which tags to remove.
If given a string, then all the tags that start with the given string will be removed.
If given a regex, then all the tags which match the regex will be removed.

#### Examples:

1. Remove tags started with `abc` from the `this` bot.
```typescript
removeTags(this, "abc");
```

2. Remove tags named `hello` using a case-insensitive regex from the `this` bot.
```typescript
removeTags(this, /^hello$/gi)
```

### `renameTag(bot, originalTag, newTag)`

Renames the given original tag on the given bot or list of bots to the given new tag.
If the original tag does not exist on the bot, then no changes will take place.
If the new tag already exists on the bot, then it will be overwritten with the contents of the original tag.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that should have the tag renamed.

The **second parameter** is the name of the tag that should be renamed.

The **third parameter** is the new name that the tag should have.

### `animateTag(bot, tag, options)`

Animates the tag on the given bot based on the specified parameters.
Returns a promise that resolves when the animation is finished and throws an error when the animation is canceled.
This is useful for gradually changing a tag on a bot over time. For example, moving a bot from point A to point B without teleporting it.

<ActionLink action='animateTag(bot, tag, options)'/> is fully integrated with tag masks.
This lets you animate tag values in the `tempLocal`, `local`, `player`, and `shared` spaces.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that the tag should be animated on.

The **second parameter** is the tag that should be animated.

The **third parameter** are the options that should be used to animate the tag.
If `null` is used, then any active animations for the tag on these bots will be canceled.
It should be an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The value that the animation should start at.
     * If omitted, then the current tag value will be used.
     */
    fromValue?: number;

    /**
     * The value that the animation should end at.
     */
    toValue: number;

    /**
     * The number of seconds that the animation should take to complete.
     */
    duration: number;

    /**
     * The space that the tag should be animated in.
     * If not specified, then "tempLocal" will be used.
     * If set to false, then the bot will be edited instead of using tag masks.
     * Additionally, if the specified space is the same as the space the bot lives in
     * then the bot will be edited directly.
     */
    tagMaskSpace?: 'tempLocal' | 'local' | 'player' | 'shared' | false;

    /**
     * The options for easing.
     * Can be an "easing type" or an object that specifies the type and mode.
     * If an easing type is specified, then "inout" mode is used.
     * If omitted, then "linear" "inout" is used.
     */
    easing?: 'linear'
            | 'quadratic'
            | 'cubic'
            | 'quartic'
            | 'quintic'
            | 'sinusoidal'
            | 'exponential'
            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic' 
            | {
        /**
         * The type of easing.
        */
        type: 'linear'
            | 'quadratic'
            | 'cubic'
            | 'quartic'
            | 'quintic'
            | 'sinusoidal'
            | 'exponential'
            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic';

        /**
         * Whether to apply the easing at the
         * start (in), end (out), or start and end (inout) of the tween.
         */
        mode: 'in' | 'out' | 'inout';
    }
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Animate the `#count` tag from 0 to 1 over 5 seconds.

Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the bot, array of bots, bot <TagLink tag='id'/>, or array of bot <TagLink tag='id'/> that the whisper should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the whisper. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listener for the specified bots.

The **third parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots named `Bob`:

The **second parameter** is the optional `that` argument to include with the shout.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `hello` super shout to all the loaded stories.
```typescript
superShout("hello");
```

### `remote(action, target?)`


Sends the given action to another player.

In CasualOS, all actions are messages which are placed in a queue and processed one at at time.

For example, the <ActionLink action='player.toast(message, duration?)'/> action queues a message which, when processed, will show a toast message.
However, before any action is performed, it is run through the <TagLink tag='@onServerAction'/> listener which can decide whether reject an action using <ActionLink action='action.reject(action)'/>.
This lets you write rules for what actions each player is allowed to take.

There are a couple special cases. First, when you send/receive an action from someone else (i.e. they sent an action to you using the <ActionLink action='remote(action)'/> function), it won't run by default.
Instead it is wrapped as a `device` action and sent to <TagLink tag='@onServerAction'/> for processing. This lets you decide whether to allow players to send messages to each other and what the effect of those messages are.
If you want to perform the action, you can use <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/> on the inner device action to queue it for execution.

The **first parameter** is the action to send.

The **second parameter** is optional and is a object specifing which player to send the action to. If not specified, then the action is sent to the server player.
If specified, then the action is sent to all players that match the given values. If given a string, then the action is sent to the player with the matching ID.

#### Examples:

1. Send a toast message to another player.
```typescript
// TODO: Get the bot ID of the other player.
const otherPlayerBotId = 'otherPlayerBotId';

// Create a toast action
const toastAction = player.toast('My message!');

// Send the action to the other player
// The toastAction will not be performed locally because
// it is being sent to another player.
remote(toastAction, otherPlayerBotId);
```

### `remoteWhisper(playerId, name, arg?)`

Sends a <TagLink tag='@onRemoteWhisper'/> shout to the player with the given ID or players if given a list of IDs.
This is useful for sending arbitrary messages to specific players.

The **first parameter** is the player ID or list of player IDs that the shout should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the event that is being sent. This is useful for telling the difference between different messages.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a "custom" message to another player.
```typescript
const otherPlayerBotId = "otherPlayerBotId";

// The other player will receive a @onRemoteWhisper with 
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
remoteWhisper(otherPlayerBotId, "custom", "Hello");
```

2. Send a message to all other players.
```typescript
const players = await server.players();
const playerId = getID(player.getBot());
const otherPlayers = players.filter(id => id !== playerId);

// All other players will receive a @onRemoteWhisper with
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
remoteWhisper(otherPlayers, "custom", "Hello");
```

### `remoteShout(name, arg?)`

Sends a <TagLink tag='@onRemoteWhisper'/> shout to all the players in the current server.
The listener will be triggered on all players connected to the server, including the local player.

The **first parameter** is the name of the message that is being sent. This is useful for telling the difference between different messages.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a message to all players.
```typescript
// All players will receive a @onRemoteWhisper with
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
remoteShout("custom", "Hello");
```

### `action.perform(action)`


Queues the given action to be performed at a later time.

The **first parameter** is the action that should be performed.

#### Examples:

1. Perform a toast message by manually queuing it.
```typescript
action.perform({
    type: 'show_toast',
    message: 'My toast message!',
    duration: 2000 // 2 seconds in miliseconds
});
```

### `action.reject(action)`


Prevents a previous action from being performed.

This is especially useful when used in a <TagLink tag='@onServerAction'/> listener since it lets you reject actions before they are performed.

The **first parameter** is the action that should be prevented/rejected.

1. Prevent a toast message from being performed.
```typescript
const toastAction = player.toast("my message");
action.reject(toastAction);

### `server.setupServer(server, botOrMod?)`


Sends an action to the server that will create the given server if it does not exist and places a clone of the given bot or mod in it.
The new bot will only be added to the server if the server did not exist.
The action is only executed if <TagLink tag='@onServerAction'/> has been configured to perform events in `device` actions.

Returns a promise that resolves when the server has been setup.

The **first parameter** is the ID of the server that should be setup.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the bot or mod that should be cloned into the new server. After the bot is created, <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> will be triggered.

#### Examples:

Before `server.setupServer()` will work, you need to setup the <TagLink tag='@onServerAction'/> tag to execute events from remote devices.
This is because when you run `server.setupServer()` from a PC or phone (a.k.a. A "remote device"), it needs to send an event to the server to actually create the new server.
By default, AUX does not perform actions that are received from a remote device. You must instruct AUX to execute these yourself.

Ensure that <TagLink tag='@onServerAction'/> is setup properly.
The following script will execute `setup_server` events that were sent from other devices:
```typescript
// Device actions are actions that were sent to this computer from another device
if (that.action.type === 'device') {

    // The setup_server action is the action that is created
    // from server.setupServer()
    if (that.action.event.type === 'setup_server') {

        // Execute the setup_server action
        action.perform(that.action.event);
    }
}
```

1. Create the "test" server:
```typescript
await server.setupServer("test");
```

2. Create the "test" server with a bot inside it:
```typescript
await server.setupServer("test", {
    "name": "bob",
    "color": "red"
});
```

3. Create the "test" server with a bot that places a bot in the "abc" dimension:
```typescript
await server.setupServer("test", {
    "onCreate": `@
        create({
            creator: null,
            label: "This is in the dimension!",
            color: "blue",
            abc: true
        });

        destroy(this);
    `
});
```

### `crypto.encrypt(key, data)`

[Encrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) the given data using the given secret key (also commonly known as a password) and returns the result.

Use the <ActionLink action='crypto.decrypt(key, data)'/> function to decrypt the data.

_Always use a strong and unique secret key._ Use a password manager such as LastPass or 1Password to help you create and keep track of them.

Assuming a strong secret, this method will return a string of encrypted data that is _confidential_ (unreadable without the key),
_reliable_ (the encrypted data cannot be changed without making it unreadable), and _authentic_ (decryptability proves that this specific key was used to encrypt the data).

As a consequence, encrypting the same data with the same key will produce different results.
This is to ensure that an attacker cannot correlate different pieces of data to potentially deduce the original plaintext.

Encrypts the given data using an authenticated encryption mechanism 
based on [XSalsa20](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/stream_ciphers/xsalsa20) (An encryption cipher) and [Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305) (A message authentication code).
Additionally uses [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) for [password-based key derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function). 

The **first parameter** is the key that should be used to encrypt the data. Use a strong an unique secret for maximum security.

The **second parameter** is the string data that should be encrypted.

#### Examples

1. Encrypt the given data and toast it.
```typescript
const encrypted = crypto.encrypt("key", "hello, world");
player.toast(encrypted);
```

### `crypto.decrypt(key, data)`

[Decrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) the given data using the given secret key (also commonly known as a password) and returns the result.

Use the <ActionLink action='crypto.encrypt(key, data)'/> function to encrypt the data.

The **first parameter** is the key that should be used to decrypt the data. This should be the same key that was used to encrypt the data.

The **second parameter** is the data from <ActionLink action='crypto.encrypt(key, data)'/> that should be decrypted.

#### Examples

1. Decrypt the given data and toast it.
```typescript
const decrypted = crypto.decrypt("key", "v1.vWUhsdfiKkxXi9Rt+BBNbcP/TiHZpxUL.iikPvWN6rNncY3j045gM0268MoRi0NNf.IpWYgzXQmjRea4MNLDXB1GmrinWLSSOMw+NfqeE=");
player.toast(decrypted);
```

### `crypto.keypair(secret)`

Creates a keypair that can be used to [digitially sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) and verify data.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/> and <ActionLink action='crypto.verify(keypair, signature, data)'/> to sign and verify the data.

Keypairs are made up of a private key and a public key.
The private key is a special value that can be used to create digital signatures and
the public key is a related value that can be used to verify that a digitital signature was created by the private key.

The private key is called "private" because it is encrypted using the given secret
while the public key is called "public" because it is not encrypted so anyone can use it if they have access to it.

Note that both the private and public keys are randomly generated, so while the public is unencrypted, it won't be able to be used by someone else unless
they have access to it.

The **first parameter** is the secret that should be used to encrypt the private key of the keypair.

#### Examples:

1. Create a keypair and toast it.
```typescript
const keypair = crypto.keypair("my secret");
player.toast(keypair);
```

### `crypt.sign(keypair, secret, data)`

Calculates the digital signature for the given data using the given keypair and secret (also commonly known as a password).

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.keypair(secret)'/> to create a keypair that can be used to create signatures.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.verify(keypair, signature, data)'/> to validate signatures.

Digital signatures are used to verifying the authenticity and integrity of data.

This works by leveraging asymetric encryption but in reverse.

If we can encrypt some data such that only the public key of a keypair can decrypt it, then we can prove that
the data was encrypted (i.e. signed) by the corresponding private key.

And since the public key is available to everyone but the private
key is only usable when you have the secret, we can use this to prove that a particular piece of data was signed by whoever knows the secret.

Note that because of how digital signatures work, signing the same data with the same keypair will produce the same signature.

The **first parameter** is the keypair that should be used to sign the data.

The **second parameter** is the secret that was used to encrypt the private key of the keypair.

The **third parameter** is the string data that should be signed.

#### Examples:

1. Create a signature for the string `"hello"`.
```typescript
// Returned from crypto.keypair()
const keypair = "vK1.ugqz8HzhaQhfORc8Coc6WVHTciMrcmfSUuw99KLRJYk=.djEuak1QNkF5MHFzMTBFMXRHamR1ZFhqTmRTV3AycjVyZUsudzFjSWZWVUFQVUdqK3hTM000NUduYUlNQ094SUhCTUEuanYrZEQwNVJFVGo3UzRPSklQQUkxc3U0anZjUmxrTEM2OW1BajkyMkxxdTFZd2sxNzV5QW9Dc3gwU3RENlQ0cmtNTVk4b2Zna2JRVTIrQmp5OUIrTTJsaFI2ajcyb0lJdmdSWkRXRU9lZE09";

const signature = crypto.sign(keypair, "my secret", "hello");
player.toast(signature);
```

### `crypto.verify(keypair, signature, data)`

Validates that the given signature was created by the given keypair for the given data.
Returns true if the signature is valid. Returns false otherwise.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.keypair(secret)'/> to create a keypair that can be used to create signatures.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/> to create signatures.

The **first parameter** is the keypair that was used to create the signature.

The **second parameter** is the signature that was returned from <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/>.

The **third parameter** is the data that was used in the call to <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/>.

#### Examples:

1. Validate a signature.
```typescript
// Returned from crypto.keypair()
const keypair = "vK1.ugqz8HzhaQhfORc8Coc6WVHTciMrcmfSUuw99KLRJYk=.djEuak1QNkF5MHFzMTBFMXRHamR1ZFhqTmRTV3AycjVyZUsudzFjSWZWVUFQVUdqK3hTM000NUduYUlNQ094SUhCTUEuanYrZEQwNVJFVGo3UzRPSklQQUkxc3U0anZjUmxrTEM2OW1BajkyMkxxdTFZd2sxNzV5QW9Dc3gwU3RENlQ0cmtNTVk4b2Zna2JRVTIrQmp5OUIrTTJsaFI2ajcyb0lJdmdSWkRXRU9lZE09";

// Returned from crypto.sign()
const signature = "vS1.uF93ErJBhdI/vqRF2XD2zgRAO96vKc9mx8crn6Kasijmx92px36B/alLGluU22tgCav/nNQEHdV2zZoHPgy7Dg==";

const valid = crypto.verify(keypair, signature, "hello");
player.toast(valid);
```

### `crypto.createCertificate(certificate, secret, keypair)`

Creates a new certified bot (also known as a certificate) from the given keypair that is signed by the given certified bot using the given secret (also commonly known as a password).
Returns a promise that resolves with the new bot.

Certificates are useful for creating signatures for tag values that CasualOS is aware of and will validate for you.

Certificates are similar to keypairs except that they themselves are signed by another certificate.
This creates a [chain of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust) that can be used to establish the validity of any arbitrary certificate.
The certificate that created the signature is called the "signing/signer certificate" and the certificate that recieved the signature is called the "signee certificate".

Each certificate contains the following information:

- A keypair.
- A reference to the signing certificate.
- A signature from the signing certificate.

In CasualOS, there are two types of certificates:

1. Root certificates.
2. Non-root certificates.

_Root certificates_ are certificates that are both signee and signer. This means that the certificate used its own keypair to create the signature.
As such, the validity of the certificate cannot be checked apart from simply trusting it. Only one root certificate is allowed per server on a first-come first-serve basis.
Once a root certificate is created for a server, another cannot be created.

_Non-root certificates_ are certificates that are signed by another certificate. This means that another certificate's keypair was used to create the signature.
As such, the validity of the certificate can be checked by following the chain of trust back to the root certificate.
If the chain does not end at the root certificate for the server, then the certificate is invalid and any signatures created by it will also be invalid.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.keypair(secret)'/> to create a keypair that can be used to create signatures.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.signTag(certificate, secret, bot, tag)'/> to create signatures for a certificate.

The **first parameter** is the certified bot that should be used to sign the new certificate. If given null, then the new bot will be self-signed.

The **second parameter** is the secret that should be used to decrypt the private key. If the first parameter is null, then this should be the secret for the keypair.

The **third parameter** is the keypair that the new certificate should have.

#### Examples:

1. Create a root certificate and toast the Bot ID:
```typescript
const keypair = await crypto.keypair('secretForRootCert');
const cert = await crypto.createCertificate(null, 'secretForRootCert', keypair);

player.toast(getID(cert));
```

2. Create a non-root certificate and toast the Bot ID:
```typescript
const rootKeypair = getBot('id', rootCertID);

const nonRootKeypair = await crypto.keypair('secretForNonRootCert');
const nonRoot = await crypto.createCertificate(rootCert, 'secretForRootCert', nonRootKeypair);

player.toast(getID(nonRoot));
```

### `crypto.signTag(certificate, secret, bot, tag)`

Creates a signature for the given bot, tag, and current value using the given certificate and secret.
Returns a promise that resolves once the tag value has been signed.

When a signature is created for a tag value, the value is considered valid until it is changed or the certificate is revoked.

The **first parameter** is the certificate bot that should be used to create the signature.

The **second parameter** is the secret used to decrypt the private key of the certificate.

The **third parameter** is the bot whose tag value should be signed.

The **fourth parameter** is the tag whose value should be signed.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.createCertificate(certificate, secret, keypair)'/> to create certificates that can be used with this function.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.verifyTag(bot, tag)'/> to verify that a tag has a valid signature.

#### Examples:

1. Sign the `@onClick` script on a bot.
```typescript
const cert = getBot('id', certID);
await crypto.signTag(cert, 'secretForCert', bot, 'onClick');
```

### `crypto.verifyTag(bot, tag)`

Validates that the tag value stored in the given tag on the given bot has been signed by a valid certificate.
Returns true if the tag value is valid. Returns false otherwise.

The **first parameter** is the bot whose tag value should be checked.

The **second parameter** is the tag whose value should be checked.

#### Examples:

1. Check if the `@onClick` script is signed.
```typescript
const valid = crypto.verifyTag(bot, 'onClick');

if (valid) {
    player.toast('onClick is valid!');
} else {
    player.toast('onClick is not valid.');
}
```

### `crypto.revokeCertificate(certificate, secret, signer?)`

Revokes the given certificate and any signatures that it has created.
In effect, this deletes the certificate bot from the server.
Additionally, any tags signed with the given certificate will no longer be verified.

Returns a promise that resolves when the certificate has been revoked.

Revoking a certificate works by creating another record (called a revocation) that is signed by either the original certificate 
or an ancestor of the original certificate. This record is then stored in the shared space and lets everyone see that the certificate is no longer valid.

The **first parameter** is the certificate that should be revoked.

The **second parameter** is the secret that should be used to decrypt the corresponding certificate's private key.
If the signer parameter is specified, then this is the secret for the signer certificate.
If the signer parameter is omitted, then this is the secret for the certificate that is being revoked.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the certificate that should be used to perform the revocation process.
If not specified, then the revocation will be signed by the revoked certificate (self-signed revocation).
If specified, then the revocation will be signed using the given certificate.
Note that any certificate that is specified must either be the original certificate or an ancestor of the original certificate.

#### Examples:

1. Revoke a certificate with itself.
```typescript
const cert = getBot('id', certificateId);
await crypto.revokeCertificate(cert, 'secretForCert');

player.toast('Certificate revoked!');
```

2. Revoke a certificate using another certificate.
```typescript
const certToRevoke = getBot('id', certToRevokeId);
const signingCert = getBot('id', signingCertId);

await crypto.revokeCertificate(certToRevoke, 'secretForSigningCert', signingCert);

player.toast('Certificate revoked!');
```

## Admin Actions

### `adminSpace.unlock(password)`

Unlocks the admin space using the given password.
Returns a Promise that resolves once the space is unlocked.
The promise will be rejected if the space was unable to be unlocked.

If given the correct password, admin space will be unlocked and become editable.

The **first parameter** is the password that should be used to unlock admin space.

#### Examples

1. Unlock admin space.
```typescript
try {
    await adminSpace.unlock("my-password");
    player.toast("Admin Space Unlocked!");
} catch(err) {
    player.toast("Failed to unlock admin space " + err);
}
```

### `adminSpace.setPassword(oldPassword, newPassword)`

Sets the password that should be used to unlock admin space.
Returns a Promise that resolves once the password is changed.

If given the correct password, admin space will use the new password.

The **first parameter** is the password that is currently used to unlock admin space.

The **second parameter** is the password that should be used to unlock admin space.

#### Examples

1. Change the admin space password.
```typescript
try {
    await adminSpace.setPassword("old-password", "new-password");
    player.toast("Admin Space Password Changed!");
} catch(err) {
    player.toast("Failed to change the password " + err);
}
```

## Custom Portal Actions

Custom portals are a way to create your own portals inside CasualOS.
Unlike listen tags, they provide the ability to interact directly with HTML and make it easy to reuse code.
This makes them very powerful for creating experiences that you have full control over.

Custom portals are designed to work hand in hand with [JavaScript Modules](https://javascript.info/modules-intro) and they
provide several features to make using other modules easy. In particular, Custom portals allow importing scripts from other tags and scripts from the web.

#### Examples:

1. A custom portal that displays "Hello, World!".

First, create a bot and open it in the sheet. Then create the `main` tag and type the following into it:
```
📖const div = document.createElement('div');
document.body.appendChild(div);
div.textContent = 'Hello, World!';
```

Next, create an `onClick` tag and type this:
```
@await portal.registerPrefix('📖');
await portal.open('my-portal', '📖main');
```

Finally, click the bot to start the portal. You should see a white frame appear over the top half of the screen and have the text "Hello, World!" in it.

### `portal.open(portalId, tag, options?)`

Registers a custom portal with the given ID and options. Returns a promise that resolves when the portal has been registered.
Can be called multiple times with new options to override previous options.

After calling this function for a portal, CasualOS will look for tags that are referenced by the specified tag via import statements and produce a script bundle that is injected into the portal.
Additionally, whenever one of those tags are changed the portal will be reloaded with the new bundle.

The **first parameter** is the ID that the portal should have. This is used to distinguish portals from each other.

The **second parameter** is the tag or source code that the portal should be loaded from.
This value can be prefixed with a registered prefix to limit which tags can be used as entrypoints.
The `mode` property of the options parameter determines whether this parameter should be a tag or some source code.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the options that the portal should use. It is an object and should have the following structure:

```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The mode that the portal should operate in.
     * 
     * "Tag" indicates that second parameter should be interpreted
     * as a tag name and that the portal should be loaded from that tag.
     * 
     * "source" indicates that the second parameter should be interpreted
     * as some source code and the portal loaded directly from the source.
     * 
     * Defaults to "tag".
     */
    mode?: "tag" | "source";

    /**
     * The CSS styles that should be used for the portal.
     */
    style?: any;
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Open a custom portal for the `test` tag.
```typescript
await portal.open("my-portal", "test");
```

2. Open a custom portal for `test` tags that are prefixed with `🔺`.
```typescript
await portal.registerPrefix('🔺');
await portal.open("my-portal", "🔺test");
```

3. Open a custom portal with a custom CSS style.
```typescript
await portal.open("my-portal", "test", {
    style: {
        height: '30%'
    }
});
```

4. Open a custom portal with some source code.
```typescript
await portal.open("my-portal", `console.log("Hello, Portal!");`, {
    mode: "source"
});
```

### `portal.registerPrefix(prefix)`

Specifies that the given prefix should be used to indicate that the tag contains script content that can be used in a custom portal.
Use this function to specify custom prefixes that function similarly to `@` or `🧬`.

The **first parameter** is the prefix that should indicate that the rest of the tag value is a script.

#### Examples:

1. Add `📖` as an script prefix.
```typescript
await portal.registerPrefix("📖");
```

2. Register some arbitrary text as a prefix.
```typescript
await portal.registerPrefix("myPrefix");
```

### `portal.buildBundle(tag)`

Builds a script bundle for the given tag and returns a promise that resolves when the build is done.
This function is useful for getting the code that portals would use.

Resolves with an object that has the following structure:
```typescript
let result: {
    /**
     * The tag the bundle was built from.
     */
    tag: string;

    /**
     * The source code that the bundle contains.
     * If an error occurred, then this will be null/undefined.
     */
    source?: string;

    /**
     * The error that occurred while building the bundle.
     * Null/Undefined if an error did not happen.
     */
    error?: string;

    /**
     * The list of warnings that occurred while building the bundle.
     */
    warnings: string[];

    /**
     * The map of Bot IDs to tags that are contained in the bundle.
     */
    modules: {
        [id: string]: Set<string>;
    };
};
```

The **first parameter** is the tag that the bundle should be built from. This value can be prefixed with a registered prefix to limit which tags can be used as entrypoints.

#### Examples:

1. Get a script bundle for the `test` tag.
```typescript
const bundle = await portal.buildBundle("test");
```

## Experimental Actions

### `experiment.localFormAnimation(bot, animation)`

Locally plays the given animation on the given bot.

If an animation is already playing, it will be interrupted.
When the given animation is finished playing, the interrupted animation will be restored.

The **first parameter** is the Bot or Bot ID that the animation should be played on.

The **second parameter** is the name or index of the animation that should be played.

#### Examples

1. Play the "jump" animation on this bot.
```typescript
experiment.localFormAnimation(this, "jump");
```

### `experiment.localPositionTween(bot, dimension, position, easing?)`

Locally plays a tween that moves the given bot in the given dimension to the given position.
Optionally allows customizing the easing of the tween.

Returns a promise that resolves when the tween is finished.

While the tween is playing, any updates to the bot's position and rotation are ignored.
Once the tween is done playing, any change to the bot will reset the position/rotation.

The **first parameter** is the bot or ID of the bot that should be tweened.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the bot should be tweened in.
Note that the tween will only work if the given dimension is currently in the page portal or inventory portal.

The **third parameter** is the position that the bot should be tweened to. If you exclude a dimension (like `x`, `y`, or `z`), then it will remain unchanged.

The **fourth parameter** is optional and is the options that should be used.
It is an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The amount of time that the tween takes to complete in seconds.
     * The maximum duration is 24 hours (86,400 seconds).
     * The minimum duration is 0.
     * Defaults to 1 if not specified.
     */
    duration?: number;

    /**
     * The options for easing.
     * Defaults to "linear" "inout" if not specified.
     */
    easing?: {
        /**
         * The type of easing.
        */
        type: 'linear'
            | 'quadratic'
            | 'cubic'
            | 'quartic'

            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic';

        /**
         * Whether to apply the easing at the
         * start (in), end (out), or start and end (inout) of the tween.
         */
        mode: 'in' | 'out' | 'inout';
    }
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Tween the bot to X = 10 in the `home` dimension.
```typescript
experiment.localPositionTween(
    this,
    'home',
    {
        x: 10,
    });
```

2. Tween the bot over 5 seconds.

    },
    { 
        easing: {
            type: 'quadratic',
            mode: 'inout'
        }
    });
```

### `experiment.localRotationTween(bot, dimension, rotation, easing?)`

Locally plays a tween that rotates the given bot in the given dimension to the given rotation.
Optionally allows customizing the easing of the tween.

Returns a promise that resolves when the tween is finished.

While the tween is playing, any updates to the bot's position and rotation are ignored.
Once the tween is done playing, any change to the bot will reset the position/rotation.

The **first parameter** is the bot or ID of the bot that should be tweened.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the bot should be tweened in.
Note that the tween will only work if the given dimension is currently in the page portal or inventory portal.

The **third parameter** is the rotation that the bot should be tweened to in radians. If you exclude a dimension (like `x`, `y`, or `z`), then it will remain unchanged.

The **fourth parameter** is optional and is the options that should be used.
It is an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The amount of time that the tween takes to complete in seconds.
     * The maximum duration is 24 hours (86,400 seconds).
     * The minimum duration is 0.
     * Defaults to 1.
     */
    duration?: number;

    /**
     * The options for easing.
     * Defaults to "linear" "inout" if not specified.

        }
    });
```

### `experiment.getAnchorPointPosition(bot, dimension, anchorPoint)`

Gets the absolute position in the given dimension that the center of the given bot would be placed at if the bot was using the given anchor point.

The **first parameter** is the bot that the anchor point position should be calculated for.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the anchor point position should be calculated in.

The **third parameter** is the anchor point that should be calculated. Can be any valid <TagLink tag="anchorPoint"/> value.

#### Examples:

1. Get the top anchor point of the current bot in the "home" dimension.
