# Development Setup

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have all the prerequisite tools installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 12.16.2 or later.
    -   If installing for the first time, it is reccommended that you install it via Node Version Manager. ([Mac][nvm-mac], [Windows][nvm-windows])
    -   Once NVM is installed, you can install the correct version of Node by running `nvm install 12.16.2` in your favorite terminal.
-   [Deno](https://deno.land/).
-   Docker ([Mac][docker-for-mac], [Windows][docker-for-windows])
    -   Used to make development with MongoDB easy.
    -   Once installed, make sure the `./docker/services/data` directory is shared with docker:
        -   On Mac you can get to this via:
            -   Docker Menu (On top bar) -> Preferences... -> File Sharing and add the `./docker/services/data/db` directory.
        -   On Windows:
            -   After running the command in step 4, docker will ask if you want to share the drive with it.

## First Time Setup

1. Clone the repository.
    - `git clone https://github.com/casual-simulation/casualos.git`
    - On Windows you should clone to a custom folder since `aux` is a reserved file/folder name.
        - e.g. `git clone https://github.com/casual-simulation/casualos.git cs-aux`
2. Make sure Lerna is installed.
    - `npm install -g lerna`
3. Bootstrap the project.
    - `npm run bootstrap`
4. Start related services:
    1. `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
5. (Optional) Add `player.localhost` to your [hosts file][hosts-file].
    - You can use this domain to prevent the service worker from installing.
    - Follow these steps:
        1. Open the hosts file as Sudo/Admin.
            - On Max/Linux it's at `/etc/hosts`
            - On Windows it's at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
        2. Add entries to route `player.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`:
            ```
            127.0.0.1 player.localhost
            ```

## Commands

When developing there are a couple of key commands you can run.
Most of them are NPM scripts, so they're easy to run.

-   Build & Run in Watch Mode
    -   `npm run watch`
    -   This will trigger webpack to start in watch mode and run nodemon.
    -   When ready, the server will be available at http://localhost:3000.
-   Build in Production Mode
    -   `npm run build`
    -   This will trigger Webpack in production mode.
    -   The output files will be in the `dist` folders of each project.
-   Run tests In Watch Mode
    -   `npm run test:watch`
-   Run tests
    -   `npm test`

You can find other scripts in the `package.json` file at the root of the repository.

## Deployment Process

Making new releases for CasualOS is pretty simple. All that needs to happen is for the `master` branch to be updated and pushed to Github. From there a webhook is sent to the CI server which instructs it to make a new build and push it to production.

The version number shown in the app is taken from the most recent git tag. We additionally package the git commit hash just in case `master` is pushed multiple times without updating the git tag.

Additionally, the CI server will publish the `aux-common` NPM package whenever the version number in its `package.json` is updated.

**To make a new release, use this process:**

1. Make sure everything you want to release is ready and merged into `develop`.
2. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file with the next version number, date, and changes that were made since the last version.
3. Commit the updated CHANGELOG to the `develop` branch.
4. Merge the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.
    - Don't use [fast-forward](https://ariya.io/2013/09/fast-forward-git-merge). (`--no-ff`)
    - Don't push yet.
5. Run `lerna version`.
    - This will look at the changes made and prompt you for the next version number.
    - In most cases all you need to do is select **patch**.
    - After confirmation lerna will update the `package.json` version numbers, add a git tag, and push the branch.
6. You're done.
    - GitHub will send a webhook to the CI server which will make a build and publish everything.
